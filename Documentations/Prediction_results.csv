The Tardeo Diana bridge is a very unsafe area especially afternoon times and on holidays. a lot of harassment and chain snatching incidents are happening very often as there are many escape routes especially towards the railway lines. Similarly the small lane below the bridge near Bai RFD Panday GIrls High School and the staircase from the bridge leading to the below parsi colony always has drug addicts and such types of people hanging around drinking and smoking drugs. The bridge is so unsafe that a debris truck since the last 3  4 years every month practically dumps an entire truck load of debris tight on the bridge and no body has yet caught him. Imagine what can happen to a woman in such an area....The main problem is that the bridge is divided into two police stations and perhaps neglected for the same reason.,0,1,0,0,1,0,0.33

"This is one of the most talked about incident to be heared from the people living in the vicinity of the 5th block colony, koramangala, bangalore.

This  mostly happens during the afternoon at around 530 600, though the timings diversify. A man stops at one of the shady location right in front of the Baithani high school and sometime it would be right outside Lakshmi park, he would try to seek attention or imbibe fear on the minds of people walking alongside the road and most of it would be done when a girl would pass by him. This are things which is considered not so normal in our society, things like opening your undergarments and showing your most private areas especially to young teenage girls. it happens most of the time in the evening when college going girls would come out of their hostel or pg's for a stroll.

"I think there is no woman who has not gone through some form of sexual harassment in this country. It is sad that I cant step outside my home without a hint of fear in my mind. I have had experiences standing at my bus stop as a child, with a friend of mine waiting for my school bus to come, when a man in a big car took rounds throwing pieces of paper with his number written on it. Then there was another time when I was standing outside my house waiting for a friend to come pick me up when a car stopped and refused to leave until he saw my friend come. For God's sake right outside my house?!? I would like to state another example when me and my friend were returning from the market in a rickshaw and we were followed by a car full of men passing lewd comments and the rickshaw guy had the sense of taking a different route. When he dropped us home he asked us quotDidi kya aap un logo ko jaanti thiquot? and i replied saying no, and his answer was quotisliye maine doosra raasta le liyaquot. What i'm trying to say here is that it is not just the poor and uneducated people to blame every single time, there are quoteducated menquot from well to do families in big cars doing this!!! Another time i was stopped by a well spoken man on the defence colony  kotla road again in a big car asking if i want to be friends and whether he can drop me home, when i said no he kept following me, i had to go to a crowded place in my market in the colony to get away from him. Another thing i would like to say is that the I am a resident of Defence Colony which is quotsupposedlyquot a colony for the defence people, should be safe but sadly it isn't. Nearly every evening i notice prostitutes standing in nooks and corners amp cars stopping and picking them up inside the colony itself. There are a number of lady boys who stand right at road that turns into Defence Colony opposite the Lajpat Nagar metro station. At the turn there is a police check post at night for so called quotsecurity reasonsquot and they stop cars as and when they want (only when they're bored or want to make some money). Do they not know that these lady boys/prostitutes stand there and get picked up every night??? What is the police doing??? It happens right under their noses and they're oblivious to it!!! This is a great initiative but i hope it continues and is not short lived. We really need to do something to bring about a change in the mindset of people in this country which ironically worships goddesses !!",1,1,0,1,1,0,0

Instead of showing sympathy towards that girl everyone standing there was blaming her and her dressing sense. Why don't you teach your sons to behave in respectful manner? One similar incindent happened with me when I was in 5th standard i was wearing short top and skirt and went to my neighbours house with my mom. There my aunt told my mom to not allow me to wear these kind of clothes as this will affect their daughters thinking.

"It was around 230 noon, me and my friend were walking on our way to meet a friend, when suddenly a car stopped,next to us, the driver asked me, the way to Brookefield Hospital. I directed him, and told him the way towards the Hospital. Actually the hospital was exactly opposite to the location in which we were walking. After I told him, the location, he drove a bit ahead from us, and then slowed down his car, I suspected he was watching us in his rear view mirror. I told my friend that something was not right about this driver, and that we needed to turn around and take a busy street, but she ignored saying, that , this is a safe locality, nothing happens here. Meanwhile, she got busy on a call and went a few steps ahead of me, in meantime I caught up with his car, he was driving parallel to me, as I was walking. I tried to ignore him, and started walking fastly. He caught up with me, stopped his car next and asked me ,If I wanted a lift till Brookefield Hospital, I told him, that i was alright, and I needed no lift, but after that he insisted, and asked me to sit next to him, and then when i denied,and started to walk away from his car, he asked me to come look at something, he was pointing towards his lap, suddenly he rose from his seat and showed his genital. I was shocked, and dumbstruck, before i  could understand what did just happen to me,he drove off. It was daylight, I could not note down his car plate number.Maybe I could have been a bit more braver, and done something about it, then and there.",0,1,0,0,1,0,0
