   "text": "We are not safe walking.  We are not safe running.  We’re not safe riding bicycles.  We’re not safe driving our cars unless the doors are locked and even then, probably not safe enough.  We’re not safe if we’re older.  We’re not safe if we’re children.  We’re not safe in the daytime, and definitely not at night-time.  We’re not safe if we’re in sloppy running gear rather than short skirts or high heels.  We’re not safe with make-up on and our hair done, and not safe without.   We’re not safe if we’re sober, and if we’re drunk we’re just asking for it.  Samantha Murphy was just going for a walk, or a jog.  Yet because she was alone without the protection of companions, she has presumably been killed by a young man who’s just been charged with her murder: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-07/samantha-murphy-ballarat-missing-woman-police-murder-charge/103558284?utm_source=abc_news_app&utm_medium=content_shared&utm_campaign=abc_news_app&utm_content=link  There are no words for the anguish of this.  We just want to vomit.   Samantha was one of FIFTEEN women who’ve allegedly been murdered in Australia this year, most by their own intimate partners or exes.   That’s not many fewer than one every single fucking week.  It’s a national emergency, but you wouldn’t know it judging by what politicians and the media are saying and doing about it.  They’re more concerned about the non-existent chance Australia will introduce nuclear power in some faraway fantasy future than they are about women being violently killed on walking trails and streets, in public places, and all too often in their own fucking home.  Sure, it’ll make the news today and tomorrow. There’ll be platitudes and promises and hand-wringing and speeches.  But nothing will fucking change. Nothing will be any fucking different for the next woman to go through this blind fucking terror and face this abject woman-hate, or the next.   Tomorrow is International Women’s Day, and the pink-cupcakes-and-happy-speeches brigade have already started their stupid and pointless bleatings.   Most of these #IWD dinners and events have been planned by women, yet men will attend and eat food prepared by women and cleaned up by women and slap themselves on the back as if they’ve done something decent.  Tomorrow, men all over social media will praise women and say they value women and care about our safety while continuing to use gendered and appearance-based slurs against women they don’t like and having a fucking go at all the women they don’t approve of.   And the media will say things about women’s rights and women’s issues as if they, too, give a fuck and don’t spend the rest of the year dominating, destroying and harming women in all kinds of ways both big and small, including employing rapists and abusers and allowing sexist, hateful male viewpoints to dominate everywhere where public voices speak loudest.   Never forget it was WOMEN who had to get serial violent misogynist Alan Jones sacked: men didn’t do jack shit about him.  None of their words mean shit and in any case, all this fucked-up posturing is nothing more than virtue-signalling for their own link clicks or in other words: just another way to get and maintain male power.   What’s the fucking point of a breakfast or a dinner or a social media love-fest or a goddamn brass band parade for women while our murders keep going up and up and up and nothing stops them while hatred of us in the media and on social media continues unabated?  Samantha Murphy had a right to her life, as did every woman whose life has been taken for nothing but the crime of being female.  And unless men here and everywhere start to take some real fucking responsibility for what their cohort do to us, nothing will fucking change.   Happy IWD.  Excuse us if we don’t join in with all the stupid fucking celebrations.   #WomenMatter #MurdochFreeWorld #ItsTheMisogynyStupid",
