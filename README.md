# Project Repository

This repository contains codes and documentation for a project focused on the identification and classification of sexual harassment using machine learning techniques. It also includes a web application and a web scraping tool.

## Codes

### MachineLearning
- **Model1**
  - Contains code for training a DistilBERT model to identify sexual harassment in text.
  - Files:
    - Code for training the DistilBERT model.
    - Code for making predictions using the trained model.

- **Model2**
  - Contains code for classifying the type of sexual harassment.
  - Subfolders:
    - **Model2_part1**: Prediction of whether there is Commenting involved.
    - **Model2_part2**: Prediction of whether there is Staring involved.
    - **Model2_part3**: Prediction of whether there is Touching involved.

### WebApp
- **FlaskServer**
  - Contains Flask application integrating all four machine learning models.
  
- **NodeServer**
  - Contains code for connecting to MongoDB database and handling API requests.
  - Files:
    - `app.js`: File handling API requests and sending responses.

- **React-Server**
  - Contains CSS and React components.
  - Subfolder:
    - **src**: React components.

### WebScrapping
- Contains Python code used to scrape tweets from Twitter.

## Documentation

### Architecture Design
- PDF document detailing the architecture of the project.

### Visualization
